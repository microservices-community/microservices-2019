Microservices 2019 will feature the **Microservices 2019 Hackathon** as a satellite event of the conference. 

A hackathon is an event where software developers meet to work intensively on one or several projects in a given problem domain. The goals of a hackathon are multiple: come up with a functioning prototype, experience new technologies and approaches, celebrate the joy of coding with
other technology enthusiasts.

At the Microservices 2019 Hackathon you will be able to meet **researchers and developers** from international groups and companies, working on innovative tools to tackle the many challenges of the design, development, and deployment of microservices. In this edition, participants will work together on a microservice architecture for the **electromobility domain**, learning how to bring microservices to life with new, **emerging tools and technologies**, subject of intensive research efforts --- Innovation included!

The Microservices 2019 Hackathon will take place on **Friday, February 22nd**. One day after the main conference event, but at a different **location**: [Otto-Hahn-Stra√üe 23, 44227 Dortmund](https://www.google.de/maps/dir//Otto-Hahn-Stra%C3%9Fe+23,+44227+Dortmund/@51.4893687,7.4041574,18.25z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x47b918ff74f56f03:0xe2c7824ff6f33bd5!2m2!1d7.4046201!2d51.48917!3e0).
