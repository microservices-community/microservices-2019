Slack is a proprietary, cloud-based tool to collaborate, chat, and share
files. 

Microservices 2019 provides a [Slack channel](https://fh.do/ms2019-slack) to its attendees. All attendees are invited to join the channel to continue their discussions started at the conference and share their ideas with the [community around it](https://microservices.community).

*This privacy statement is relevant only to participants of Microservices 2019,
who are not employed by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund.
If you are an employee of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund,

Please read the disclaimer below before registering to the Microservices 2019 Slack workspace.

The Slack workspace is a completely free and optional offer by the conference
organisers. Your registration for the Slack workspace happens on a voluntary

contact the organisers. If you want to contact the organisers and do not want
to use Slack for that purpose, please use the [contact form](/2019/contact/) on
the conference website.

Because the registration for the Microservices 2019 Slack workspace happens
on a voluntary basis, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund

contract regarding the processing of your data is concluded between you and
Slack Technologies, Inc. The University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund
does not store or process any of the data you provide to Slack during the
registration for the service or its usage.

In case you provide any personal data to a person of the conference staff via
Slack, we will reject your inquiry and remind you to use the [contact
form](/2019/contact/) to provide personal data to us, if necessary. That is,
because the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Dortmund does not occur as
a contracting party in the data processing. The data processing contract is
concluded between you and Slack Technologies, Inc. only.
