INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MICROSERVICES
=========================================

The **International Conference on Microservices** is a forum for the
discussion of all aspects of microservices: their design, programming, and
operations.

Microservices 2019 is part of a series of conferences, started with
Microservices 2017, which successfully brought together many international
practitioners and researchers interested in the software paradigm of
microservices. During Microservices 2017 the Microservices Community was
founded, with the aims of sharing of knowledge, fostering of collaborations,
and organising events around microservices. In this edition, Microservices
will be co-located and intertwined with the first international edition of the
Meeting on Microservices, an event specifically oriented towards companies
where invited speakers from industry report success stories, best practices,
current challenges, and attendees participate to discussion panels on the
adoption and evolution of microservices in production.

ABOUT MICROSERVICES'19
======================

The 2019 edition of the conference (Microservices 2019) will take place from
February 19th to 21st, 2019 at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts
Dortmund, Germany.

The theme of this edition is the interplay between **microservices** and the
**Digital Transformation**, i.e., the process of accelerating and improving
business activities, processes, and models through digital automation. This
process is crucial for companies in highly-competing markets, where
integration and flexibility of software systems becomes a critical asset to
establish leadership. Here, microservices can play a central role. They can
streamline integration (thanks to their focus on standards and
interoperability) and enable more flexible solutions (by supporting dynamic
deployments and elastic scaling).

However these benefits come at a cost: an increased complexity that calls for
a proportional improvement of techniques for software construction. This
requires contributions from different areas, ranging from formal methods to
software engineering and the general art of programming.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
==================

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Design and implementation of microservice architectures.
- Empirical studies of microservices.
- Software engineering methods for microservices.
- Security in microservices.
- Formal models for microservices.
- Verification (both static and runtime) of microservice systems.
- Programming languages and techniques for microservices.
- Testing for microservices.

See https://conf-micro.services/2019/ for full details.

We solicit contributions in the form of extended abstracts with a maximum
length of two pages. A submission should describe a talk to be given at the
event. Talks can be based on work in progress, scientific work published or
submitted for publication, or practical experience reports. Practical
demonstrations of tools are also welcome. Extended abstracts of accepted
contributions will be available electronically before the conference.

Microservices 2019 will employ a lightweight reviewing process.

SUBMITTING & DEADLINE
=====================

The deadline for submissions is November 30th, 2018, Anywhere on Earth.
Authors will be notified on the acceptance of their submissions from January
18th, 2019. Resubmissions are allowed until the submission deadline.
Contributions are to be submitted through EasyChair using the following link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=microservices2019

FORMATTING
==========

Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on A4 paper,
and interpretable by common PDF tools. All submissions must be prepared using
the Easychair template, available for LaTeX
(https://easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip) and MS Word
(https://easychair.org/publications/easychair.docx).

POST-PROCEEDINGS
================

Depending on the success of this initiative, we are considering the
publication of a volume of post-proceedings, for which there will be a
separate call for papers. In this way, the interested authors will have a
chance to enrich their contributions according to the feedback they received
during the event. The tentative deadline for submitting papers for the
post-proceedings is mid-May 2019.
